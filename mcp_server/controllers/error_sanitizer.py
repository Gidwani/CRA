"""Client-facing error sanitization for the native MCP endpoint.

Single chokepoint that decides what an MCP client may see when something goes
wrong: never leak tracebacks, source paths, SQL/driver internals, constraint
names or memory addresses to clients.

Two cases:

* **User-facing Odoo exceptions** (``UserError``, ``AccessError``,
  ``ValidationError``, ``MissingError`` -- including the module's own MCP gate
  errors, which are raised as ``UserError``/``AccessError``) carry messages
  authored for end users. Their message passes through, still defensively
  scrubbed in case it ever embeds an internal detail.
* **Database constraint failures** (``psycopg2.IntegrityError``: NOT NULL,
  foreign-key and unique violations) are translated with Odoo's own
  ``_sql_error_to_message`` -- the field/model-naming text the web client
  shows -- then scrubbed; the driver's raw fallback text is genericized.
* **Every other exception** is reduced to a single generic message while the
  full traceback is preserved server-side via the logger -- so an unexpected
  ORM/psycopg/Python error can be diagnosed from the server log without ever
  reaching the client.

A mapping that *rewrites* raw XML-RPC fault strings into friendlier text is
intentionally omitted: native tools raise clean ``_()``-translated Odoo
messages directly, so rewriting them would only lose information and could mask
the user-safe gate messages the suite relies on.
